Mine Escape Game

# Overview
This project simulates an escape from a mine using an algorithm that applies stack data structures to navigate through obstacles like walls, lava, and locked doors. The program implements pathfinding using stacks and checks for valid movements between cells while collecting gold and unlocking doors with keys.

# Features
Pathfinding: Uses a stack-based algorithm to track movements within the mine grid.
Obstacle Navigation: Avoids lava, walls, and other hazards while collecting keys and gold.
Custom Stack Implementation: Implements a dynamic stack using an array, including methods for push, pop, peek, and dynamic resizing.

# Classes
ArrayStack.java: Implements a custom stack using an array, with dynamic resizing.
MineEscape.java: Implements the pathfinding algorithm to find an escape route from the mine.
MapCell.java: Provided class representing various types of cells (floor, wall, lava, etc.) within the mine.

# Technologies Used
Java
